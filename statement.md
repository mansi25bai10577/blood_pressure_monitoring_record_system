Blood Pressure Monitoring System

>Problem Statement

Many individuals lack a convenient way to consistently record, review, and analyze their blood pressure readings at home. Without proper tracking, it becomes difficult to identify trends, catch potential health risks early, or provide doctors with comprehensive data to inform care. Manual logging can be error-prone and does not classify measurements according to medical guidelines.

>Scope of the Project

This application provides a command-line interface for users to store, view, and analyze their blood pressure readings. The focus is on individual health management and personal use. The project categorizes every reading per established American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines and offers basic statistical summaries of the results. The tool does not interface with external databases, electronic medical records, or mobile devices, keeping data management local and private.

Individuals monitoring their own or a family member’s blood pressure

Health-conscious users who want a simple digital log
